# AUTOMATIC PARKING SYSTEM
The system is built on a web application by using flask and Google Vision API for text detection and recognition.
The system also uses [DeepFace model architecture](https://research.facebook.com/publications/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification/) for face recognition and Haar Cascade Classifier Algorithm for face detection using OpenCV library
